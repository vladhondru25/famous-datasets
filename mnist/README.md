# LeNet5

The implementation of LeNet5 [1] in PyTorch and Tensorflow.

## How to run

The code is written as a Jupyer Notebook. It can pe run locally if [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) in installed. In order to run it, just run the cells in their respective order. 

### Recommendation

If either JupyterLab is not installed on the machine or a faster training is desired, [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) can be used. It does provide free GPU for a limited amount of time, but more than sufficient to train LeNet5.
